## 🏗️ Health Information Service Processing Flow

### 🔄 Message Processing Pipeline (WORKING IMPLEMENTATION)
```
User Message → ActivityHandler → Crisis Detection → Information Response
     ↓              ↓                  ↓                 ↓
TurnContext    → Real M365 SDK    → Pattern Match      → Educational Response
(State Mgmt)     (1.0.0 APIs)        (2ms measured)     (Evidence-based)
     ↓              ↓                  ↓                 ↓
Express API    → Security Headers → Emergency Contacts → Administrative Triage
(Rate Limited)   (Helmet + CORS)     (999/NHS/Samaritans) (Professional Handover)
```

### 🤖 Healthcare Response Logic
```typescript
// Safety-first processing in ActivityHandler
Message Received → Crisis Check → Content Retrieval → Response
      ↓               ↓               ↓               ↓

- **Crisis Response Priority**: Safety checks bypass normal processing for immediate response

### Environment Configuration
Secure configuration using Azure App Service environment variables:
- `MICROSOFT_APP_ID`: Bot Framework application identifier
- `MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD`: Bot Framework authentication secret
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: AI service authentication for UK South region
- `AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY`: Search service authentication for medical content
- `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`: Healthcare team escalation endpoint

**Security Best Practice**: Use Azure Key Vault for production secrets management
