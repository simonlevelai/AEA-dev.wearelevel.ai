## 🛠️ Development

### Microsoft 365 Agents SDK Development Workflow
Multi-agent architecture with specialized healthcare responsibilities:

1. **Safety Agent**: `src/agents/SafetyAgent.ts` - Crisis detection <500ms
2. **Content Agent**: `src/agents/ContentAgent.ts` - MHRA-compliant health information  
3. **Escalation Agent**: `src/agents/EscalationAgent.ts` - GDPR-compliant nurse callbacks
4. **ChatManager**: `src/services/ChatManager.ts` - Agent orchestration framework
5. **Widget Integration**: `ask-eve-widget.js` - The Eve Appeal website deployment

### Contributing to M365 SDK Implementation
1. All changes must pass multi-agent orchestration tests
2. Maintain <500ms crisis response time requirement (currently 402ms)
3. Preserve MHRA compliance with multi-agent validation
4. Test agent-to-agent communication protocols
5. Follow TDD for safety-critical agent interactions
6. Validate widget integration across platforms
