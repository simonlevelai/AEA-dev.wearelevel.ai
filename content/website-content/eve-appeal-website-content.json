      "content": "The first results showed that the test was able to detect up to 30% more women with breast and ovarian cancer than current genetic-based tests.\n\nThe WID-Test works by looking at the DNA Methylation of cells taken from a cervical screening sample. DNA methylation sits on top of the DNA and tells the cell which DNA to read and action, it’s like the software of our cells if the DNA is the hardware. DNA methylation is altered by lifestyle factors like diet, hormones and smoking.\n\nThe WID-Test doesn’t just detect cancers. The test also looks at how each individual responds to their environment and lifestyle factors, which can also impact the risk of developing cancer in the future.",

      "content": "By bringing these two factors together, the researchers are aiming to develop a screening programme that predicts the risk of these four cancers and enables women and people with gynae organs to take steps to help prevent cancer from developing.\n\nBreast, womb, ovarian and cervical cancers account for more than half of all cancers in women in Europe, that’s around 250,000 people diagnosed with these cancers each year in Europe alone, and almost 45,000 die from them.\n\nThe WID-Test could change the future of cancer screening practices. By looking at genetics, lifestyle and environment, this allows a full view of future risk of developing these four key cancers, from just one cervical screening sample.",
