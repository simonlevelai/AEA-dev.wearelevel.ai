There are more than 200 \ntypes, which can be divided into \n“high risk” and “low risk”\n1\n. Only some \nof them infect the genital skin and \nare classed as sexually transmitted \ninfections (STIs). High risk types of \nHPV can sometimes lead to certain \ncancers, although this is rare\n2\n. \nHow common is HPV?\nHPV is very common and around \n80% of people will get it in their \nlifetime. In most cases it has no \nsymptoms and will usually be cleared \nby the immune system without \ncausing any problems\n3\n. \nTypes of HPV\nGenital HPV\nGenital HPV is spread by skin-to-skin \nsexual contact – penetrative sex, oral \nsex, anal sex, sexual touch, and by \nsharing sex toys.\nAny area of the genitals can become \ninfected, including the anus, and it \ncan be spread from the genital area \nto the anus without having anal sex. \nHPV that causes genital infections \ncan be divided into low-risk and \nhigh-risk types. Low-risk HPV can \ncause genital warts, and high-risk \nHPV can cause changes to the \nHPV\nGenital HPV\nNon-genital  \nHPV\nTypes    \n6 and 11\nTypes    \n16 and 18\nWarts and \nverrucas\nGenital warts\nThroat and \nmouth cancer\nAnal cancer\nPenile cancer\nCervical cancer\nVulval cancer\nVaginal cancer\nPeople of all genders \n4\n\ngenital skin, which may lead to \ncancer. Being infected with one \ntype of HPV does not increase your \nlikelihood of being infected with \nanother type.\nNon-genital HPV\nThe non-genital forms of HPV can \ncause warts inside the mouth, on  \nthe fingers, hands, knees, and the \nsoles of the feet (verrucas). High-\nrisk HPV can lead to cancers of the \nthroat and mouth.\nStigma\nThere is a lot of stigma and \nconfusion associated with HPV, \nwhich can lead to unnecessary \nanxiety, especially when talking to \nsexual partners. It’s important to \nremember that HPV infections are \nvery common, are usually harmless \nand clear up without needing \ntreatment, and are nothing to feel \n‘dirty’ or ashamed about. Even if you \ndo have HPV, the chances of you or \nyour partner developing cancer are \nvery low – but it’s important to be \naware of the signs and symptoms, \njust in case. You’ll find lots of useful \nmyth busters throughout this guide, \nwhich you can share with friends or \npartners who might have concerns \nabout HPV.\nPrevention\nTrying to prevent HPV means reducing \nas many risk factors as possible.\nBarrier methods of contraception are \nrecommended to reduce the likelihood \nof passing on or getting any sexually \ntransmitted infection, however these \ndon’t offer full protection from HPV: \n• It’s a good idea to use condoms \nwhen having vaginal or anal sex \n• External condoms can be placed \nover a penis (or sex toy), and \ninternal condoms can be used \nwithin the vagina, or anus if the \nring is removed\n• External condoms are also \nrecommended when performing \noral sex on a penis \n• Dams (latex or plastic square \nsheet) are recommended for oral \nsex performed on a vulva or anus\n• Avoid sharing sex toys, or wash \nthem and use a condom \n• If you’re also using lubricants, \navoid oil-based products as these \ncan cause condoms to break\nMyth: If I’ve always used \ncondoms, I’m not at risk of HPV.\nFact: Condoms can help reduce \nthe likelihood of transmitting HPV \nand other STIs. However, barrier \ncontraception – including external \nand internal condoms and dams \n– do not cover all the genital \nand anal areas. It is possible for \nthe skin not covered by barrier \ncontraception to be infected with \nHPV. You can’t get HPV from \nhugging, sharing baths or towels, \nfrom swimming pools, toilet seats \nor from sharing cups, plates or \ncutler y.\nPeople of all genders \n5\n\nThere is a vaccine that protects \nagainst some types of HPV. The one \ncurrently used in the national HPV \nprogramme in the UK is Gardasil 9, \nwhich protects against HPV 6, 11, \n16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and will \nhelp prevent genital warts as well as \nsome types of cancer.\nIn the current UK vaccination \nprogramme, Gardasil is offered to \nall young people aged 12-13, usually \nthrough school. Men and people \nassigned male at birth who have sex \nwith men and are aged 16-45 are \nalso eligible for free HPV vaccines \nfrom sexual health and HIV clinics.\n4\n \nSex workers and people who are \nimmunosuppressed are eligible for \nthe vaccine.\nIf you are eligible but missed the HPV \nvaccine at school, you can still have \nit free on the NHS up until your 25th \nbirthday. The vaccine will be most \neffective for those who haven’t been \nexposed to the virus, so it’s best to \nhave it before starting sexual activity. \nHowever, there may still be benefits \nto being vaccinated against HPV, \neven after potentially you have been \nexposed to infection and it is possible \nto have the vaccine privately up to the \nage of 45.\nMyth: You can’t get HPV if you’re \na ‘virgin’ (haven’t had penetrative \nsex).\nFact: This depends on how you \nand your partner define being a \nvirgin. Often we think of ‘losing \nour virginity’ when penetrative sex \noccurs (i.e. a penis in a vagina or \nanus). If you or your partner have \nnot had penetrative sex before, you \nmight still consider yourselves to \nbe virgins. However, there is still a \nrisk of infection if either of you have \nhad oral sex or sexual touch, as \nHPV is passed through skin-to-skin \ncontact. Therefore, it is important to \ndiscuss all sexual activity you and \nyour partner may have engaged \nin and whether precautions were \ntaken with barrier contraception. \nMyth: Only people who have \ncasual sex/multiple partners get \nSTIs.\nFact: STIs including HPV do \nnot care about your sexual \nhistory. While having sex with \nmultiple partners may increase \nthe likelihood of encountering \nsomeone with an STI, transmission \nof STIs only requires one sexual \nexperience with an infected \npartner. Due to HPV and other STIs \noften not having symptoms, your \nsexual partners may be unaware \nthey have one, whether they are a \nlong-term or casual partner. \nMyth: Lesbian women cannot get \nHPV.\nFact: Lesbian and bisexual women \ncan get HPV from skin-to-skin \ncontact, either through oral \nsex, genital-to-genital sex or by \nsharing sex toys.\nPeople of all genders \n6\n\n GENITAL WARTS \nWhat are genital warts?\nGenital warts are fleshy lumps that \nform on or around the genital and anal \nskin. They can affect anyone who has \nbeen exposed to low-risk HPV.\nHow are genital warts  \npassed on?\nHPV is more likely to be passed on \nwhen warts are present but it is still \npossible to pass the virus on before \nany warts appear and after they have \ndisappeared. If you’re pregnant and \nhave genital warts at the time, it’s \npossible to pass the virus to the baby \nat birth, but this is rare.\nSigns and symptoms\nMost people with an HPV infection \nwon’t develop visible warts and \nthe virus will go away on its own. \nYou may not know whether you \nor a partner have the virus, and it \nis unlikely you will know who you \ncaught the infection from. \nIt can take anything between three \nweeks and several years for any visible \nbumps to develop. If warts do appear, \nthey can either appear on their own \nor in clusters, a bit like a cauliflower. \nYou or your partner might notice small, \nfleshy growths, bumps or skin changes, \nwhich may appear anywhere in or on \nthe genital or anal area. \nGenital warts are normally painless but \nin some people they can be itchy or \nbecome inflamed, which may lead to a \nlittle bleeding. Warts inside the urethra \n(the tube through which urine leaves \nthe body) may also distort the flow of \nurine (wee). There’s no evidence that \nyour fertility will be affected by having \ngenital warts or HPV.\nHow to get tested\nThere is no blood, urine or swab for \ngenital warts in the UK. A doctor or \nnurse will examine you and confirm \nif you have the infection. In some \ncases, they may wish to perform a \nmore detailed examination inside  \nthe vagina or anus. Very rarely, they \nmay take a biopsy (small sample) of \nthe wart and a local anaesthetic  \nmay be used. \nAnyone who is diagnosed with \ngenital warts should have an STI \ntest, including HIV and syphilis.  \nThis is because it is quite common  \nto have more than one STI at the \nsame time. You can be tested at a \nSexual Health Clinic (GUM clinic), \nBrook clinics if you’re under 25, or \nyour GP. See the end of the booklet \nfor more info.\nTreatment \nYou will only be offered treatment if \nyou have visible warts. The treatment \nwill depend on what the warts look \nlike, how many you have and where \nthey are.  \nPeople of all genders \n7\n\nTreating the warts doesn’t get rid \nof the infection in the surrounding \nskin. Tell the doctor or nurse if you’re \npregnant or trying to conceive, as \nthis may affect the type of treatment \nyou’re given.\nTreatments may include: \n• Cream you can apply yourself at \nhome for softer warts\n• Cryotherapy, or freezing therapy \nfor harder or rough-feeling warts. \nThis involves going to a clinic \nfor regular treatments (normally \nweekly) until the warts have gone\nIn some people the warts go away \nquickly but for others the treatment \nmay have to be repeated a number \nof times. In some cases, the cream \nand/or cryotherapy may not work, \nand you might need to be referred to \na specialist clinic for laser treatment \nor surgery. \nSome people only ever get one \nepisode of genital warts. For many \nothers, the warts can come back. \nIt’s not possible to say if these are \ndue to the original infection or a new \ninfection.\nProtecting your partner \nAs with any other STI, it is important \nto tell your partner that you have \ncontracted genital warts if you are \ncurrently having a flare up. It may  \nbe that they have been infected  \nwith HPV already, but do not have \nany genital warts. \nYou can protect them by using \ncondoms and dams while the warts \nare present and for the first three \nmonths after they’ve gone. While \nthis will stop the virus being passed \non from the covered areas, there \nwill still be HPV present in some of \nthe surrounding skin, so there is still \nsome risk of transmission. \nMyth: A genital warts diagnosis \nmeans someone has cheated.\nFact: Genital warts can take \nmonths or years to develop after \ninfection so it does not necessarily \nmean your partner has been \nhaving sex with other people. \nThere is no way of telling how long \nyou have been infected with HPV \nby the appearance of the warts.\nMyth: Genital warts are the same \nas warts on your hand.\nFact: Genital warts are not caused \nby the same HPV type as warts \non hands or verrucas on the feet. \nHowever, in rare cases, warts \non the hands could spread to \nthe genitals. You should not use \nover-the-counter wart or verruca \ntreatments on your genitals.\nPeople of all genders \n8\n\nTHROAT AND MOUTH CANCER\nWhat are throat and  \nmouth cancers?\nThroat and mouth cancer (sometimes \nreferred to as oral cancer) is a \nsubgroup of head and neck cancers, \nas well as cancer of the sinus and \nsalivary gland, which is much rarer\n5\n. \nThe cancers associated with HPV \naffect the oropharynx (the part of the \nthroat directly behind the mouth), \ntonsils, and the base of the tongue. \nThere are around 12,000 cases of head \nand neck cancer in the UK each year.\n• Around half of cases affect the \noropharynx\n6\n• About 1 in 4 mouth cancers and 1 in \n3 throat cancers are HPV-related\n• Most throat cancers in younger \npeople are HPV-related\n• In the UK it has been estimated \nthat 52% of oropharyngeal cancers \nare associated with HPV\n7\n, mainly \ntype 16\nWhat causes throat and \nmouth cancer?\n• HPV\n• smoking / using chewing tobacco\n• drinking alcohol\n• having a weakened immune \nsystem - eg. if you have HIV \nHPV is spread through skin-to-skin \nsexual contact, including oral sex. \nOral sex doesn’t directly cause \nmouth and throat cancers, but it \ndoes increase exposure to HPV.\nSigns and symptoms\nSymptoms can be subtle, but include:\n• A lump in the throat, or feeling \nlike something is stuck in the \nthroat\n• Darker or lighter patches on your \ntongue or throat\n• Trouble swallowing/pain when \nswallowing\n• Unexplained weight loss\n• Change in voice or hoarseness\n• A swelling in your mouth\n• One or more mouth ulcers\n• One or more painless neck lumps \n• Persistent ear pain from one side\nOropharynxynx\nPeople of all genders \n9\n\nHow to get tested\nIf any of these symptoms persist for \nmore than three weeks, you should \nvisit your GP or a dentist. There are \nmany causes of sore throats and \nlumps in the throat which are not \ncancerous, and the doctor or dentist \nshould be able to reassure you if \nthey cannot see any concerning \nsigns. They can also refer you to \na specialist if they think you need \nfurther tests and/or treatment\n8\n.\nTreatment\nTreatment options vary depending \non the cancer, but could include  \n \nsurgery to remove the tumour, \nradiotherapy and/or chemotherapy\n9\n.\nHPV-related (sometimes called HPV-\npositive) mouth and throat cancers \ngenerally respond much more \npositively to treatment and have an \noverall better outcome than those \nthat are HPV-negative\n10\n.\nPrevention\nBesides the general tips on \nprevention at the beginning of this \nguide, you can reduce your risk by:\n• using condoms for oral sex\n• stopping smoking\n• having regular check-ups with your \ndentist\n• reduce alcohol intake\nMyth: You’re less likely to get an \noral cancer if you’re giving oral \nsex to someone with a penis and \nthey don’t ejaculate (cum) in your \nmouth. \nFact: HPV isn’t associated with \ntransfer of fluids. Skin-to-skin \ncontact is what passes it from one \nperson to another. Using a condom \nfor oral sex may help to reduce the \nrisk of spreading HPV, although it \nwill not prevent it completely.\n“\n Being diagnosed with throat cancer \ntook me by complete surprise as I was fit \nand healthy. After my recovery I became \na significant voice in campaigning for \nboys to receive the HPV vaccine – a \ncampaign that paid off in 2019, when the \nGovernment changed their policy to allow \nboys to be vaccinated as well as girls.”\nSteve \nPeople of all genders \nMyth: Gay men are more likely to \nget oral cancer. \nFact: Whilst HPV oropharyngeal \ncancers ARE more common \nin men than women, they \nare actually most common in \nheterosexual (straight) men in their \n40s and 50s\n11\n.\n10\n\n ANAL  CANCER\nWhat is anal cancer?\nAnal cancer is a rarer type of cancer \nthat develops in the skin cells and \ntissue of the anus – where you \ndefecate (poo) from\n12\n. Around 1,400 \npeople are diagnosed with anal \ncancer each year in the UK\n13\n. \nWhat causes anal cancer?\nNearly all (91%) cases of anal cancer \nare caused by HPV. Other risk \nfactors include:\n• a history of abnormal cervical cells, \ncervical or vaginal cancer linked \nwith HPV\n• smoking\n• older age \n• anal sex - this doesn’t directly \ncause anal cancer, but it does \nincrease exposure to HPV\n• having a weakened immune system \n- for example, if you have HIV\n14\nSigns and symptoms\nIn the early stages, anal cancer is \noften asymptomatic, meaning there \nare no symptoms. Symptoms that do \noccur include:\n• change in the size of piles; \ndifficulty passing stools; severe \nconstipation; continuous urge to \npass a stool but unable to pass \nanything\n• Anal or rectal discharge, such as \npus, mucus or bleeding\n• Swelling, redness, itching, pain or \npressure around the anus, which \nmay be constant or brought on by \nbowel movements or sex\n• Lumps around the anus, or \nswollen lymph nodes in the groin, \npelvis or anal area\n• Loss of bowel control (faecal \nincontinence) \nHow to get tested\nIf you are concerned about any of \nthese symptoms, you should visit \nyour GP for them to examine you. \nThere are many non-cancerous \ncauses of anal bleeding and \ndiscomfort, so your doctor should \nbe able to reassure you if they \nAnus\nRectum\nAn\num\nPeople of all genders \n11\n\ncannot see or feel anything to worry \nabout. They can also refer you to \na specialist if they think you need \nfurther tests and/or treatment.\nTreatment\nDepending on the type and stage of \nanal cancer, treatment options may \ninclude chemotherapy, radiation \ntherapy and/or, in rarer cases, \nsurgery\n15\n.\nPrevention\nUsing condoms and dams for anal \nsex offers partial (but not complete) \nprotection from HPV, which can help \nto reduce your risk of infection. \nMyth: Only gay men get anal \ncancer.\nFact: More women than men are \ndiagnosed with anal cancer each \nyear. However, men who have sex \nwith men do have an increased \nrisk. Anal sex between partners \nof any gender increases the risk \nof HPV infection which, in a small \nnumber of cases, may develop \ninto cancer. \nMyth: You have to have anal sex \nto get anal cancer.\nFact: HPV can spread from the \ngenital area to the anus without \nhaving anal sex, either from skin-\nto-skin contact or by performing \noral sex on the anus (rimming).\nPeople of all genders \nMen aged 16-45 who \nhave sex with men \nare eligible for a free \nHPV vaccine from \ntheir local sexual \nhealth or HIV clinic.\n12\n\n CERVICAL  CANCER\nWhat is cervical cancer?\nCervical cancer is a cancer that \naffects the cervix (the entrance \nto the womb). It is fully treatable \nif caught early enough, and most \ncases of cervical cancer can be \nprevented thanks to the UK’s \ncervical screening and HPV \nvaccination programmes.\nWhat causes cervical cancer?\n99.7% of cervical cancers are caused \nby high-risk forms of HPV, with types \n16 and 18 responsible for around 70% \nof cases\n16\n. Many risk factors have \nbeen identified for cervical cancer, but \nsmoking is the most obvious one\n17\n. \nSigns and symptoms\n• Any abnormal vaginal bleeding, \nincluding bleeding between \nperiods or after sex or after the \nmenopause \n• Changes to vaginal discharge \n(bloody or foul-smelling).\n• Pain in the lower back or pelvis\n• Pain or discomfort during sex\n18\nHow to get tested\nIf you are concerned about abnormal \nvaginal bleeding or discharge, \nyou should not request a cervical \nscreening appointment, but visit your \nGP or a sexual health clinic for them \nto examine you. There are many \nnon-cancerous causes of abnormal \nbleeding and changes to discharge, \nand the doctor will examine you \nand may refer you to the hospital for \nfurther tests if needed”. \nTreatment\nDepending on the stage and size of the \ncancer, there are a variety of available \ntreatments – including surgery, \nradiotherapy and chemotherapy\n19\n.\nPrevention\nBesides the general tips on \nprevention at the beginning of \nthis guide, there is also a cervical \nscreening programme in the UK. This \nis offered to women and people with \na cervix without symptoms, between \nthe ages of 25 and 64.\n20\n However, \nif you are registered as male with \nyour GP, you may not automatically \nbe called and may need to request \nCervix\nWomen and people with a cervix/vagina/vulva\n13\n\nscreening every 3-5 years.\nDuring a cervical screening \nappointment, a clinician uses a \nspeculum (a smooth plastic instrument \nthat comes in a size to fit you), which is \ngently inserted into the vagina, and a \nbrush to take a sample from the cervix. \nThis is sent off to a lab, where it is first \ntested for high-risk types of HPV. If \nhigh-risk HPV is found, the sample will \nthen be checked for early changes to \ncells that, if left untreated, might lead \nto cervical cancer. Any cell changes \ncan then be treated or monitored as \nappropriate. As a result, most cases of \ncervical cancer can be prevented with \nregular screening\n21\n.\nFor those who are eligible, the HPV \nvaccination programme provides an \nextra layer of protection. \n“\n I found out I had HPV after my very \nfirst cervical screening appointment, when \nI was also diagnosed with cervical cancer. \nI had no symptoms and was only 25 – it’s \nrare but it happens. To be honest, I’d never \nreally heard of HPV before then. When I \nfirst found out I almost felt embarrassed, \nlike it was something I shouldn’t talk \nabout. It was only when I learnt more \nabout it that I realised just how common \nit was and that there was nothing to be \nembarrassed about.”\nEmma\nWomen and people with a cervix/vagina/vulva\nMyth: If you’ve had the HPV \nvaccine, you don’t need to go for \ncervical screening\nFact: The HPV vaccine protects \nagainst around 70% of cervical \ncancer cases. You still need to \ngo for cervical screening, even if \nyou’ve had the vaccine, to detect \ncell changes that may be caused \nby other types of HPV\n26\n. \nMyth: Cervical screening is only for \nwomen who have sex with men\nFact: Cervical screening is for \nanyone with a cervix, regardless \nof their gender or sexual \norientation. This means cis \nwomen, including lesbians and \nbisexual women, as well as any \ntrans men, non-binary or intersex \npeople with a cervix.\n14\n\n VULVAL  CANCER\nWhat is vulval cancer\nVulval cancer is a form of cancer that \naffects the vulva (external genitalia). \nIf left untreated, it can spread to \nnearby tissues, or to local glands. \nVulval cancer is rare, with only 1,300 \ncases\n22\n diagnosed in the UK every year.\nWhat causes vulval cancer?\nMost common risk factors are:\n• HPV \n• smoking \n• increasing age\nOther risk factors include:\n• vulval conditions like lichen \nsclerosus (a chronic inflammatory \nskin condition)\n• pre-cancerous cell changes known \nas vulval intrapithelial neoplasia (VIN)\n• having a weakened immune \nsystem so you are less likely to \nclear HPV - eg having HIV\nSigns and symptoms\n•  A persistent itch\n•  Pain or soreness\n•  Thickened, raised, red, lighter or \ndarker patches on the skin\n•  An open sore or growth\n•  Change in colour/shape of a mole\n•  A lump or swelling in the vulva\nHow to get tested\nIf you experience any of these \nsymptoms, you should visit your GP. \nThere are several non-cancerous \ncauses of lumps and sores. If \nneeded you may be referred to a \ngynaecologist, who will examine you \nand may take biopsies.\nTreatment\nDepending on the stage and size of the \ncancer, treatments may include surgery, \nradiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.\nPrevention\nEarly detection and treatment of \nlichen sclerosus\n23\n and abnormal cell \nchanges can help reduce risk.\nWomen and people with a cervix/vagina/vulva\nVulvaVu\nWomen and people with a cervix/vagina/vulva\n15\n\n VAGINAL  CANCER\nWhat is vaginal cancer?\nVaginal cancer affects the vagina \n(internal genitalia). If untreated, it can \nspread to nearby tissues, or through \nthe lymphatic system to local glands. \nVaginal cancer is rare, with only 250 \ncases\n24\n diagnosed in the UK a year.\nHPV on the vulva/vagina of trans \nwomen has not been well-studied. If \nyou spot any symptoms, visit your GP.\nWhat causes vaginal cancer?\n• HPV \n• smoking \n• age \n• abnormal/pre-cancerous cell \nchanges in the cervix (CIN) or \nvagina (VAIN) \n• having a weakened immune \nsystem and being less likely to \nclear HPV, eg if you are HIV+\nSigns and symptoms\n• Unexpected bleeding, eg. \nbetween periods, after \nmenopause or after sex\n• Unexplained vaginal discharge that \nis foul-smelling or blood stained\n• Vaginal pain during sex\n• A vaginal lump or growth\n• A vaginal itch that won’t go away \nand pain when urinating\n• Persistent pelvic and vaginal pain\nAt the earliest stages, vaginal cancer \nmay have no symptoms.\nHow to get tested\nIf you have symptoms, visit your GP. \nThere are several non-cancerous \ncauses for these symptoms. Your \ndoctor will examine you and may \nrefer you to see a gynaecologist for \nfurther tests, if needed.\nTreatment\nDepending on the stage and size \nof the cancer, treatments may \ninclude surgery, radiotherapy and/or \nchemotherapy.\nPrevention\nThe risk of vaginal cancer can be \nreduced with early detection and \ntreatment of abnormal cell changes.\nVagina\nWomen and people with a cervix/vagina/vulva\n16\n\n PENILE  CANCER\nWhat is penile cancer?\nPenile cancer affects the penis, \noften in the foreskin or the glans. \nIf untreated, it can spread to the \nnearby lymph nodes or metastasise \n(move to other parts of the body). \nIt is rare, with only 640 cases a year in \nthe UK\n25\n. However, the incidence has \nbeen rising over the past 20 years. It \nis more common over the age of 50. \nHPV on the penis of trans men has \nnot been well-studied.\nWhat causes penile cancer?\nThere are several conditions \nthat can lead to penile cancer – \nincluding lichen sclerosus (a chronic \ninflammatory skin condition) and HPV. \nAround 50-60% of patients diagnosed \nwith penile cancer will have evidence \nof the high-risk HPV types 16 or 18.\nOther risk factors include:\n• obesity and UVA phototherapy \n(light therapy used to treat some \nskin conditions)\n• other sexually transmitted \ninfections (STIs), including HIV\n• smoking\n• phimosis (tight foreskin)\nSigns and symptoms\n• Thickened or raised areas on \npenis\n• Bleeding or discharge\n• Pain, a lump or discharge under \nthe foreskin; \n• Changes in skin colour \n• Warty looking growth or lump\n• Ulcer or sore which may bleed\n• Persistent rash on the penis \nHow to get tested\nIf you have symptoms, visit your GP. \nThere are several causes of lumps \nand sores which are not cancerous. \nYour doctor will examine you and \nmay refer you to a urologist for further \ntests, if needed.\nTreatment \nDepending on the size and stage \nof the cancer, treatments can \ninclude surgery, chemotherapy \nand radiotherapy. When surgery is \nneeded, the operation will preserve \nas much of the penis and sexual \nfunction as possible.\nMen and people with a penisWomen and people with a cervix/vagina/vulva\n17\nForeskinForeskin\n\nRESOURCES \nSexual Health\nAnyone can use these services, \nregardless of age, disability, \nethnicity, religion, gender and sexual \norientation.

The more we know, the \nmore we can do to help save lives. \nSome people have an increased risk of cancer\nThere are many things that either cause or contribute to someone getting \ncancer. These can be related to lifestyle, environment, or simply as a result \nof a person’s genetic makeup. Being at an increased risk of cancer does not \nmean you will develop it, but it does make it more likely, so it is important to \nbe aware of symptoms and get any worrying changes checked.\nLynch Syndrome and understanding your options \nPeople with Lynch Syndrome are at a higher risk than the general population  \nof developing some cancers. Identifying people who have Lynch Syndrome  \ncan have important benefits, including prevention of cancer, spotting it early  \nand helping doctors decide on the best treatment for people who do  \ndevelop cancer. \nIf you have been impacted by a diagnosis of Lynch Syndrome, you are not \nalone. Around 25 million people across the world live with this syndrome.\ni \nMost people with Lynch Syndrome live a normal life; however, being diagnosed \nwith it does carry important considerations – for individuals and families. \nThis booklet aims to help you understand more about the syndrome, what \nyour options are, and the support that is available. When making a decision  \n– make sure you have the right information and never be afraid to ask \nquestions.

This acts as a set of  \ninstructions for how our cells function and grow. \nDNA contains thousands of genes, which each contain a small piece of the \ninformation our bodies need to function. \n \nWhat happens when genes get altered?\nThe genes that we are born with quite commonly have changes in their \ncode called gene alterations, sometimes referred to as gene ‘mutations’,  \nor ‘variants’. Having gene alterations is quite common. However, the impact \ncan vary from nothing at all to being potentially quite serious. \nWhat is Lynch Syndrome?\nLynch Syndrome is a condition which increases a person’s risk of certain \ncancers. It is caused by an alteration in one of five different genes (MLH1, \nMSH2, EPCAM, MSH6 and PMS2). \nHelen\n4\nA BIT ABOUT LYNCH SYNDROME\n“Many people with Lynch might never get cancer, \nbut if I do, I know the choices I've made to get \nmy Lynch diagnosis, ensuring I have my regular \nsurveillance, and being aware of the symptoms  \nI should be on the lookout for, will mean I'm in the \nbest possible position should the worst happen.  \nI was 25 when I was diagnosed with Lynch; I’m now \nin my early 30’s and whilst I still have what I’ve called \n‘Lynch wobbles,’ they are fewer and less frequent, and \nwith the knowledge of how underdiagnosed Lynch is, \nI feel in such a privileged position to have access to \nscreening, information and support.” \n4\n\nHow do you get Lynch Syndrome?\nLynch Syndrome is usually inherited (or ‘hereditary’) but can very occasionally \noccur with no family history – this is known as ‘sporadic alteration’. Typically, \nyou will inherit Lynch Syndrome from your mother or your father. If one parent \nhas Lynch Syndrome there is a 1 in 2 (50%) chance that each of their children \nwill have it.\nHow common is it?\nIt is thought that around 1 in every 400-450 people have Lynch Syndrome. It \nis estimated that around 175,000 people in the UK could be living with Lynch \nSyndrome, although up to 95% may not be aware of it.\nii\n \nWhy does Lynch Syndrome increase the risk of some cancers?\nIn our cells, there are natural processes that defend us from cancer – from \nrepairing damaged DNA to destroying potentially dangerous cells. In Lynch \nSyndrome, the ability to properly ‘proofread’ newly formed DNA is lost.  \nThis means that any errors are not spotted or corrected. These errors can \nbuild up, eventually affecting the bodily processes that usually prevent \ncancer formation. When this happens, an individual is at a greater risk of \ndeveloping cancer.\n5\n\nHow likely is it that someone with Lynch Syndrome will  \ndevelop cancer? \nWhile many people with Lynch Syndrome will not develop cancer, links have \nbeen found to a range of different types. \nLynch Syndrome mainly carries a risk of developing bowel and womb \ncancer, but it also increases the risk of other cancers like ovarian, stomach, \npancreas, prostate, urethral, kidney, brain, as well as skin tumours.\nBeing diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome may take some time to get used \nto. The information gained from the test is important because it can guide \ndoctors to enrol you on surveillance programmes to help spot cancers early \nwhen they are easiest to treat. Further, doctors can sometimes prescribe \npreventative medicines and treatments, known as personalised medicines. \nA Lynch Syndrome diagnosis also gives people an opportunity to assess \nlifestyle changes that can reduce the risk of cancer.\nRISK OF CANCER FOR PEOPLE WITH \nLYNCH SYNDROME\n6\nPLEASE NOTE: Depending on the gene alteration, the risk  \nof cancer will be different. \nFor gene-specific information, please read: The Royal Marsden's \nbeginner's guide to Lynch Syndrome or use the Prospective \nLynch Syndrome Database (PLSD) risk calculator\n\n7\nBOWEL CANCER\nOVARIAN\nWOMB (endometrial/uterine)\nUROTHELIAL\nGENERAL POPULATION\nLIFETIME RISK IN MALES*\n1 in 15 for males (7%)\niii\nLIFETIME RISK IN FEMALES*\n1 in 18 for females (6%)\niii\nGENERAL POPULATION\nLIFETIME RISK IN MALES*\n1 in 55 for males (1.8%)\n 1,vii,viii\nLIFETIME RISK IN FEMALES*\n1 in 143 for females (<1%)\n2, vii, viii\nGENERAL POPULATION\nLIFETIME RISK IN FEMALES*\n1 in 50 for females (2%)\niv\nGENERAL POPULATION\nLIFETIME RISK IN FEMALES*\n1 in 36 for females (3%)\nvi\nLIFETIME RISK WITH LYNCH SYNDROME** \nUp to 4 in 5 people (80%)\nii\nLIFETIME RISK WITH LYNCH SYNDROME** \nUp to 1 in 4 people (28.5%)\nix\nLIFETIME RISK WITH LYNCH SYNDROME** \nUp to 1 in 6 people (16%)\nv\nLIFETIME RISK WITH LYNCH SYNDROME** \nAround 1 in 2 females (50%)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n7%\n6%\n2%\n80%\n16%\n3%\n50%\n1.8%\n<1%\n28.5%\n\n8\nSTOMACH (Gastric) \nPANCREAS \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n1%\n2%2%\n<1%\n13%\n4%\nGENERAL POPULATION\nLIFETIME RISK IN MALES*\n1 in 76 for males (1%)\nx\nLIFETIME RISK IN FEMALES*\n1 in 130 for females (<1%)\nGENERAL POPULATION\nLIFETIME RISK IN MALES*\n1 in 53 for males (2%)\nxii \nLIFETIME RISK IN FEMALES*\n1 in 57 for females (2%)\nxii\nLIFETIME RISK WITH LYNCH SYNDROME**\nAround 1 in 5 people (13%)\nxi \nLIFETIME RISK WITH LYNCH SYNDROME** \nUp to around 1 in 25 people (4%)\nxiii\nPROSTATE\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n18%\n36%\nGENERAL POPULATION\nLIFETIME RISK IN MALES*\n1 in 6 for males  (18%)\nxiv\nLIFETIME RISK WITH LYNCH SYNDROME**\nEstimated to be around 1 in 3 people (36%)\nxv\n\n9\nBRAIN\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n1%\n2%\n6%\nGENERAL POPULATION\nLIFETIME RISK IN MALES*\n1 in 69 for males (1%)\nxvi\nLIFETIME RISK IN FEMALES*\n1 in 65 for females (2%)\nLIFETIME RISK WITH LYNCH SYNDROME** \n1 in 17 for males (6%)\n1 in 16 for females (6%)\nxvii\n1  \nCalculated based on 1 in 50 lifetime risk of bladder cancer, multiplied by 90% of bladder cases being caused by \nurothelial tumours\n2\n Calculated based on 1 in 130 lifetime risk of bladder cancer, multiplied by 90% of bladder cases being caused by \nurothelial tumours\n*Estimates of general lifetime risk are typically based on adults in the UK born after 1960, although this may vary  \nin some cases. \n**Estimates for lifetime risk in Lynch Syndrome are based on available data; but it can vary depending on lots of factors \nsuch as which gene is altered, your age, sex and lifestyle.\n***Muir Torre Syndrome (a type of skin tumour) also have an increased lifetime risk for people with Lynch Syndrome,  \nbut the data is not currently available to accurately include these in the above diagram.\n\nLynch Syndrome is identified through a genetic test. The testing may be \nslightly different depending on whether you have been diagnosed with \ncancer, or if you are being tested because a relative has been diagnosed \nwith Lynch Syndrome (‘predictive genetic testing’). If you are diagnosed with \ncertain cancers, you may be automatically tested for gene alterations.\nI’ve got a history of cancer in my family, should I get  \ntested for Lynch Syndrome?\nCancer is quite common. However, if you have a family history of cancer \n(particularly bowel and womb cancer) there is the possibility that it could \nbe linked to Lynch Syndrome. The only way to be sure of whether you \nhave Lynch Syndrome in your family is for you or any close family members \n(siblings, parents, children) to be referred to a genetics specialist who \nwill provide genetic counselling and advice on getting tested. Genetic \ncounselling provides emotional support and information to help you and \nyour family with making health decisions. Speak to your GP if you would like \nto discuss getting referred. \nYou may be eligible for genetic testing for Lynch Syndrome if:\n-  You have two or more close family members (sibling, parent, child) who \nhave had bowel cancer, womb or ovarian cancer\n-  You or a close relative has had bowel or womb cancer at a young age \n(under 50)\nCan anyone be tested for Lynch Syndrome?\nUnless there is a strong likelihood that you may have Lynch Syndrome,  \nyou are unlikely to be able to access predictive genetic testing for free  \non the NHS. \nTESTING FOR LYNCH SYNDROME\nLynch Syndrome does not skip generations.  \nIf you do not have a gene alteration associated \nwith Lynch Syndrome – even if your parent or \nsibling does – you will not pass it on to any \nchildren or grandchildren.\n10\n\nWhat does a Lynch Syndrome genetic test actually look for?\nWhen looking to see whether a person has Lynch Syndrome,  \nthe test looks for alterations in five different genes. These are called:\n \n \n \n \nThe cancer risks are slightly different for each gene, so it is important for both  \nthe clinical team and the individual to know which specific alteration is present. \nKeep in mind that, even if alterations are found during testing, their impact can \nvary from being potentially serious to nothing at all and many people with  \nLynch Syndrome live a normal life.\nWhat does the test for Lynch Syndrome involve?\nLynch Syndrome is diagnosed by testing for the presence of specific altered \ngenes in a person’s DNA. The NHS typically uses a blood test.\nIf you have a cancer that doctors suspect is linked to Lynch Syndrome...\nIn this case, doctors will initially conduct some tests on the tumour that has  \nbeen removed. If these tumour tests suggest you could have Lynch Syndrome, \nyour doctor will discuss this result with you. You will be invited to have a blood  \ntest to diagnose Lynch Syndrome. As this test is complex, results may take  \nweeks or months. Your clinical team will be able to advise how long you may  \nhave to wait for your results.  \nIf you are a relative of someone who has been diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome... \nIf you decide after genetic counselling to have a test (known as ‘predictive \ntesting’), a blood sample is tested in a lab to see if you have the same gene \nalteration found in your family member with Lynch Syndrome. \nMLH1\nMSH2\nMSH6\nPMS2 \nEPCAM\n11\n\n                                                                 \n12\nWHY KNOWING MATTERS\nCan knowing I have Lynch Syndrome help reduce the chance  \nof getting seriously ill from cancer?\nWhile it is not yet possible to completely remove the risk of cancers related \nto Lynch Syndrome, being diagnosed offers the opportunity to take steps to \nminimise the risk. Some of these steps include: \n For women and people with gynaecological organs, you may be   \n offered risk-reducing surgery which will prevent womb and ovarian    \n cancer from developing.\n Attending regular cancer surveillance:\n Lifestyle changes may be advised, such as weight loss, quitting   \n smoking, or reducing alcohol consumption.\n It’s really important to become more aware of the signs of cancer \n and know what to do if these are spotted.\n You may discuss the use of daily aspirin with your doctor, as it has     \n been  shown to greatly reduce bowel cancer risk in people with  \n Lynch Syndrome.\nxix  \nWHY KNOWING MATTERS\na. This may include having a regular colon and rectal examination,  \nwhich is called a colonoscopy\nb. For women and people with gynaecological organs, surveillance may \ninclude getting your womb checked, called a hysteroscopy\nxviii \nc. For men and people with a prostate, surveillance may include  \na prostate examination\nd. You may be offered Helicobacter pylori testing, which is important  \npart of stomach (gastric) surveillance \n\n                                                                 \n13\nWhat is cancer surveillance?\nSurveillance means regular check-ups to see if there are any early signs \nof cancer, including any precancerous changes (such as bowel polyps), so \nthat any disease can be found as early as possible, when they are more \ntreatable. If anything is discovered, steps can be taken to address the \nproblem quickly. If you have been diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome, you  \ncan discuss surveillance options with your clinical team, genetic counsellor,  \nor your GP.\nWhat if I do not want to find out if I have Lynch Syndrome? \nIt’s completely your choice whether to have genetic testing for Lynch \nSyndrome and it should only be done after careful consideration. There \nis help on hand to support you, whatever the outcome. This could include \nspeaking to a specialist genetic counsellor about what to say to family \nmembers, or your options for regular cancer surveillance. For further \ninformation and support, Ask Eve is always on hand, as well as peer support \nfrom Lynch Syndrome UK. You can find more details on how to access \nsupport at the end of this booklet on page 25.\n“No-one wants to be told they have Lynch \nSyndrome, let alone cancer. I found out that I \nhad both within 48 hours. Despite this, I still \nconsider myself pretty lucky. Acting quickly \non this information almost certainly saved my \nmother’s life. As soon as they learned that my \ncancer was caused by Lynch Syndrome, my \nparents got themselves checked, even though \nthey had no symptoms. Unfortunately, during \none of these checks, my mum discovered that \nshe had a tumour at each end of her colon, \nbut it had been caught early. Like me, she is \nnow more than 3 years cancer free and is able \nto live a normal life.”\nTo m\n\n14\nLIVING WITH LYNCH SYNDROME\nFinding out if you or a loved one has a condition that could increase the risk of \ncancer is not easy and it is understandable to feel anxious regarding your own \nfuture and that of your family. Over the past few years, as our understanding \nof different diseases and how they can be passed on through families has \nimproved, a lot of excellent support on these concerns has become available. \nBelow, you can find answers to some of the common questions people ask. \nIf your question is not included, please do contact the team at Ask Eve,  \nwhose contact details are at the front of this booklet. \n\n15\nPeople living with Lynch Syndrome will be invited to attend regular bowel \nsurveillance. You will usually be invited to attend bowel checks from the \nage of 25 (this is the age at which the risk of bowel cancer for people with \nLynch Syndrome increases). You may be invited from a slightly younger age \nif you have a relative who had bowel cancer before the age of 30. \nBowel checks should take place every two years and involve a \ncolonoscopy, which is when a long flexible tube with a camera on the \nend is gently inserted through the anus and along the bowel. The camera \nlooks for polyps and abnormalities in the bowel which, can be removed or \ntreated. Most polyps are harmless, but they can develop into cancer if left \nfor a long time. Any signs of cancer can also be spotted early when they are \nmore treatable.\nIt’s important to have an empty bowel before the procedure, so you will \nbe given a special diet to follow for a couple of days before, along with \nstrong laxatives to help clean the bowel. To keep you comfortable during \nthe procedure you will be given a mild sedative. Most people can leave the \nhospital on the same day.\nBowel, Colon\nWhat cancer surveillance is available?\nThere are different types of cancer surveillance available that check \nthe organs at risk of developing cancer. What surveillance is offered will \ndepend on what mutation is present, this will be guided by the genetic \n\n16\nWhile there is no firm protocol on the surveillance of the ovaries  \nand womb in people living with Lynch Syndrome, research is currently  \nbeing undertaken to understand the best approach. This makes \nknowing what is normal for you and the symptoms to look out for even \nmore important. If you have any worries or concerns about surveillance \nor symptoms, do contact Ask Eve using the details on the next page.\nOne surveillance option women and people with gynaecological organs \nmay be offered is a ‘transvaginal’ ultrasound scan (through the vagina) \nto measure the thickness of the lining of the womb. Some people may \nalso be offered a hysteroscopy, which is a procedure to look at the \ninside of the womb. \nA hysteroscopy involves a narrow telescope with a small camera at \nthe end being passed into the womb through the vagina and cervix \n(entrance to the womb). It is carried out on an out-patient or day-case \nbasis, meaning you will not need to stay at hospital overnight. A local \nanaesthetic (to numb your cervix) may be used. General anaesthetic \nmay be used if you need to have treatment during the procedure, or if \nit is your preference to be asleep. Hysteroscopies can take a maximum \nof 30 minutes to carry out but may only take 5 to 10 minutes.\nPeople have varying experiences with hysteroscopies; some feel no \npain or only a mild pain or discomfort, while some can find the pain \nsevere. If you find the procedure too uncomfortable, tell your nurse or \ndoctor as they can stop at any time. You can also speak to your doctor \nor nurse before the hysteroscopy if you are nervous or would like to \nask about pain relief.\nOvarian cancer surveillance is not widely offered as there is little \nevidence to show it is effective.\nWomb (uterus) and ovaries\n\n17\nSurveillance for prostate cancer in people living with Lynch Syndrome  \nis also less concrete than bowel surveillance.  \nA blood test to check Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels, which is a \nmarker in blood that can rise if you have prostate cancer, can be used  \nfor surveillance. \nThere is ongoing research into the risk of prostate cancer for people who \nhave Lynch Syndrome to determine whether targeted annual PSA testing \nfrom the age of 40 could lead to earlier diagnosis.  \nProstate\nnurse@eveappeal.org.uk\n0808 802 0019\neveappeal.org.uk\n\n18\nI’M WORRIED \nABOUT LYNCH \nSYNDROME – \nWHO CAN I \nSPEAK TO?\nWhether you have been diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome, or someone close \nto you has, there are a range of options where you can find information and \nsupport. Ask Eve is a good place to start, as well as patient support group \nLynch Syndrome UK (details on page 25). Another option is to speak with a \ngenetic counsellor, which may require a referral from either your GP or your \ncancer team. \nI have Lynch Syndrome – how can I tell my children or \ngrandchildren they may be at risk?\nIf you are worried about telling family, there are many support resources that \ncan help. These include advice from genetic counsellors who have specialist \nexpertise in this area. There are also discussion guides that can help you \nintroduce the topic and explain the situation to your family so they can make \ninformed decisions about what they should do.  \nThe Royal Marsden has some helpful information about this:  \nA beginner's guide to Lynch Syndrome\n\n19\nWill genetic testing and finding out I am positive for Lynch \nSyndrome affect my ability to get insurance, travel, get a \nmortgage etc? Is it better not to know?\nSometimes people are concerned that undergoing predictive genetic testing \ncould have a negative impact on their ability to take out life insurance. \nHowever, there is an agreed code of practice between insurance companies \nwhich means that ABI insurers will not use the results of genetic testing for \nhigh-risk cancers to calculate premiums or eligibility for life insurance. If you \nwould like more information, you can visit www.abi.org.uk.\nThis information is accurate at the time of printing, but rules may have \nchanged by the time you read this. We would recommend checking the ABI \nwebsite or speaking to your genetic counsellor.\nWhat if I want to have children in the future?\nYou may have questions about this if you are planning to start a family now \nor in the future. There are a number of possible routes you could take, \nincluding having children naturally; adopting; egg or sperm donation from \nsomeone who does not have Lynch Syndrome; prenatal testing; and pre-\nimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) – this is where you undergo IVF to test \nyour embryos for Lynch Syndrome and only those which do not carry the \ngene alteration are put in your or your partner’s womb. A genetics specialist \nwill be able to guide you through these options and help you decide which \nroute might be best for you.\nCan I have Hormone-Replacement Therapy (HRT) if I have \nLynch Syndrome? \nIf you have Lynch Syndrome and have not been diagnosed with cancer,  \nHRT can be taken under the advice of your GP or specialist healthcare team. \nIf you have had cancer, the decision to take HRT will need to be discussed \nwith your oncology team.\nIf you had preventive surgery for Lynch Syndrome whilst premenopausal \n(removal of your womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries), then oestrogen only \nHRT will be prescribed until the natural age of menopause. You can discuss \nyour options with your clinical team.\n\n20\nIf you or someone you know has been diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome, \nit is important to be aware of some of the symptoms of cancer. It’s always \ngood to be aware of your own body and what’s normal for you so that if \nsomething feels wrong, you can get it checked.\nxx\nSpotting cancer early often means it is more treatable, with many of the \ntreatment options being less invasive or aggressive. This means there is  \na better chance of a positive outcome and of living a fuller, healthier life. \nIn the following section, you will find more information on some of the \ncommon signs to look out for. \nSYMPTOMS TO BE AWARE OF\n22\n22\n23\n23\n24\n24\n25\n25\n25\nCONTENTS\nBowel cancer\nWomb cancer\nOvarian cancer\nStomach cancer (gastric)\nPancreatic cancer\nProstate cancer \nUrothelial bladder cancer\nSkin tumours \nBrain cancer\nSYMPTOMS TO \nBE AWARE OF\n\nNot all of the cancers listed will apply to everyone with Lynch \nSyndrome, as the risk of different cancers depends on the specific \ngene alteration. If you have any concerns – even if your symptom \nis not listed here – you should make sure that you discuss these \nwith your GP or specialist. Ask Eve is also on hand to help, and the \ncontact details are at the front of this booklet. \n“I discovered Lynch Syndrome after a stage \n4 bowel cancer diagnosis at the age of \n31. My cancer continued to grow after the \nregular chemotherapy failed. I was classed \nas having terminal cancer after there was \nno more treatment available. The cancer \nwas spreading. Lynch cancers need to be \ntreated differently. Thankfully the science \nand research continued to develop, which \nshowed immunotherapy as an option. \nIncredibly the treatment worked and now \nat the age of 39 I am cancer free.”\nMo\n21\nSYMPTOMS TO \nBE AWARE OF\n\n22\nBowel cancer\nBowel cancer describes cancer that begins in the large bowel.  \nThis is made up of the colon and rectum. Depending on where the \ncancer starts, it can sometimes be called either colon or rectal cancer.\nSymptoms of bowel cancer include:\n-   Bleeding from your bottom and/or blood in your poo – which happens \nfor no obvious reason or is associated with a change in bowel habit  \nor mucus\n-   Ongoing change in your bowel habit – this usually means having to poo \nmore regularly than normal and your poo may also become more runny; \nyou may also notice your poo becomes very dark and smells  \nmore offensive\n-   Persistent pain or lump in your tummy (lower abdominal), bloating and \ndiscomfort – this will be caused by eating\n- A loss of appetite\n- Unexplained weight loss\n-   Extreme tiredness – bowel cancer can lead to a lack of iron in the body \n(anaemia), which can make you feel very tired\nWomb cancer\nWomb cancer affects the womb (uterus) and often begins in the lining \n(endometrium). It is sometimes called uterine or endometrial cancer.\nThe main symptoms of womb cancer are: \n-   Bleeding, spotting or abnormal discharge from the vagina after the \nmenopause (if you haven’t had a period for a year or more, any bleeding \nis considered abnormal and should be checked by a GP)\n- Heavier or more painful periods than are usual for you\n- Bleeding between periods\n- Bleeding after sex\n- Blood-stained vaginal discharge (pink, red, brown)\n- Change in your bowel or urinary habits\nOther symptoms of womb cancer include lower back or pelvic pain.\nSYMPTOMS TO \nBE AWARE OF\n\n23\nOvarian cancer\nOvarian cancer occurs in one or both of the two small organs (ovaries) \nthat store the eggs needed for reproduction. Anyone with ovaries can \ndevelop ovarian cancer.\nThe main symptoms of ovarian cancer include experiencing the \nfollowing frequently (approximately 12 or more times per month): \n- A persistent swollen tummy or feeling bloated (that doesn’t come and go)\n- Pain or tenderness in your tummy or slightly lower between your hips\n- Lack of appetite or feeling full quickly after eating\n- The urgent need to wee, or needing to wee more often\nOther symptoms include:\n- Indigestion\n- Constipation or diarrhoea\n- Back pain\n- Fatigue\n- Unexplained weight loss\nStomach cancer (gastric)\nStomach cancer is a cancer that begins anywhere in the stomach. \nSymptoms can be tricky to spot, but include digestive issues such as: \n- Heartburn or acid reflux\n- Problems swallowing (dysphagia)\n- Feeling or being sick\n- Black tarry stool\n- Indigestion\n- Feeling full very quickly when eating\nOther symptoms can include:\n- Loss of appetite\n- Unexplained weight loss\n- A lump or pain at the top of your tummy\n- Fatigue\nSYMPTOMS TO \nBE AWARE OF\n\n24\nPancreatic cancer \nPancreatic cancer is a cancer that begins anywhere in the pancreas.  \nThe pancreas sits just below the stomach in your upper abdomen.  \nIt helps digest food and makes hormones like insulin. \nIt can be hard to spot symptoms of pancreatic cancer and sometimes \nthere aren’t any symptoms at all, until the cancer is advanced.  \nHowever, they can include: \n-   Jaundice – when the whites of your eyes and your skin turn yellow; \njaundice can also cause you to have itchy skin and make your wee \ndarker and poo paler than usual\n- Loss of appetite\n- Unexplained weight loss\n- Fatigue\nSymptoms can also affect your digestion. For example:\n- Feeling or being sick\n- Diarrhoea or constipation\nProstate cancer \nProstate cancer begins in the prostate, a small gland located in the \npelvis, in between the penis and bladder.\nProstate cancer can develop slowly, meaning there can be no signs  \nof it for many years. Symptoms typically appear once the prostate  \nhas grown large enough to put pressure on the tube that carries \nurine from the bladder out of the penis (urethra). At this point, \nsymptoms include:\n- An increased need to wee\n- Needing to wee more at night\n- Blood in your wee or semen\n- Sudden urges to wee\n- Straining while weeing\n- A feeling that the bladder has not fully emptied\nSYMPTOMS TO \nBE AWARE OF\n\n25\nUrothelial bladder cancer \nUrothelial cancer develops from the cells of the bladder lining (urothelium). \nBlood in your wee is the most common sign of urothelial bladder cancer. \nOther less common symptoms include: \n- A need to wee more frequently\n- Sudden urges to wee\n- A burning sensation when weeing\nSkin tumours\nSkin tumours can occur in people with a certain type of Lynch Syndrome, \nalthough it is quite rare. When they occur because of Lynch Syndrome,  \nthe condition is typically referred to as Muir Torre Syndrome.  \nMore information on this can be found here.\nBrain cancer\nThe symptoms of brain cancer depend on which part of the brain the tumour \nis growing in, but can include:\nxxi\n \n- Headaches (which are often worse in the mornings, when coughing or straining)\n- Fits or seizures\n- Frequently feeling sick or being sick\n- Problems with memory\n- Personality changes\n- Weakness, vision problems or speech problems (which get worse over time)\nSYMPTOMS TO \nBE AWARE OF\n\n26\nNOTES\n\n27\nUSEFUL RESOURCES \nThere are lots of other resources available to help you navigate Lynch Syndrome. \nWe have included a selection of helpful links here:\n The Eve Appeal – Lynch Syndrome\n Lynch Syndrome UK \n Bowel Cancer UK – Lynch Syndrome \n Target Ovarian Cancer – Gene Mutations\n Macmillan Cancer Support – Lynch Syndrome\n Ovacome – Lynch Syndrome\n Ovarian Cancer Action – Lynch Syndrome\n Cancer Research UK – Inherited genes and cancer types\n                      Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS Trust – Information leaflet  \nfor Patients and Families: Lynch Syndrome \n The Royal Marsden – A beginner’s guide to Lynch Syndrome\n East of England Cancer Alliance – Genetic testing for Lynch Syndrome\n Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database (PLSD) – Risk calculator\nReferences\ni What is Lynch Syndrome? - RM Partners\nii Diagnosis and Management of Lynch Syndrome | British Medical Journal\niii Bowel cancer risk | Cancer Research UK\niv Ovarian cancer risk | Cancer Research UK \nv Lynch syndrome and ovarian cancer | Ovacome\nvi Uterine cancer risk | Cancer Research UK\nvii Bladder cancer statistics | Cancer Research UK\nviii Types of bladder cancer | Cancer Research UK\nix Urine test can detect urothelial cancers in Lynch Syndrome patients (ncri.org.uk) \nX Stomach cancer risk | Cancer Research UK\nxi Gastric cancer in Lynch Syndrome: Are precancerous conditions co- risk factors? - Annals of Oncology \nxii Pancreatic cancer risk | Cancer Research UK\nxiii The Risk of Pancreatic Cancer in Families with Lynch Syndrome - PMC (nih.gov) \nxiv Prostate cancer risk | Cancer Research UK\nxv Elevated Risk of Prostate Cancer Among Men With Lynch Syndrome - PMC (nih.gov) \nxvi Brain, other CNS and intracranial tumours risk factors | Cancer Research UK\nxvii Extracolonic Manifestations of Lynch Syndrome - PMC (nih.gov)\nxviii A brief guide to the management of Lynch Syndrome - BSG \nxix Implementing Lynch Syndrome testing and surveillance pathways - NHS (B0622) \nxx Health A to Z - NHS (www.nhs.uk) \nxxi Risks and causes of brain tumours | Cancer Research UK\n\nFor more information, you can contact  \nThe Eve Appeal’s nurse-led information line,  \nAsk Eve.

Bleeding from your vagina when\nyou do not think you should be. \nFor example, bleeding from your \nvagina after sex. \nOr bleeding from your vagina between \nperiods if you have periods. \nOr bleeding after the menopause has \nhappened. This is when women stop \nhaving periods for good. \n2. Changes to the stuff that comes out \nof your vagina. \nFor example, there might be blood. \nOr it might smell bad. \nThe stuff that comes out of your vagina \nis called discharge. It is usually white \nor clear. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \nSome other signs of vaginal cancer are:  \n3.

Or HPV for short. \nA virus is like an illness that you can \ncatch from other people. \nPeople can get HPV from having sex \nor touching people in a sexual way. \nHPV is not usually a problem. It usually \ngoes away on its own. \nBut some types of HPV can cause \nvaginal cancer over time. \nThis does not happen often. But it is still \nbest to check if you are worried. \nThere is more information about HPV \non our website: \nhttps://eveappeal.org.uk/HPV-guide \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n  \nWays to  help to stop vaginal \ncancer   \nYoung people aged 12 to 13 can get \na vaccine. \nThe vaccine can help to stop some \npeople getting vaginal cancer. \nThe vaccine is called an HPV vaccine. \nA vaccine can help to stop some \nillnesses. \nYou get a vaccine from a doctor or nurse. \nSome people can get the vaccine for free. \nAsk your doctor if you are not sure. \nIt might also help to use condoms if you \ndo sexual things with someone else. \nAnd it can help to stop smoking if you \ndo smoke. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              \n \n \nWhat to do if you are \nworried  \nIt is important to check with your doctor \nif you have any signs of vaginal cancer. \nIt is probably not vaginal cancer. \nBut it is best to check. \nWhat might happen if you go to\nthe doctor \nYour doctor might check the inside of \nyour vagina. \nThey might use their fingers to feel a bit \ninside your vagina. \nThat is to see if they can feel anything \nwrong. \nThe doctor will wear gloves to do that. \nYou can have a nurse or someone \nyou know with you if you want. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n                   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe doctor might also look at your  cervix  \nwhen they look inside your vagina.   \nYour cervix is at the top of your vagina. \nYour doctor will try to make these checks \nas gentle as possible for you. \nYou can ask them to stop if you want to. \nYour doctor may do a test to see if you \nhave something else that is not cancer. \nLike an infection. \nIf there could be a problem \nin your vagina \nYour doctor will send you to another \ndoctor or nurse in hospital to do more \nchecks. \nThe new doctor or nurse might look inside \nyour vagina. \nThey will look for lumps or anything that \nshould not be there. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n                \n \n \n \n \nThe new  doctor or nurse might do \nanother test.  \nT\nhey might put a small tube in your \nvagina. \nThat is to help them look more closely at \nthe inside of your vagina and your cervix. \nYour cervix is at the top of your vagina. \nSometimes the doctor or nurse might take \na tiny bit of your vagina. \nThis is called a biopsy. \nThis is to check if you might have \ncancer now.

An itch on your vulva that won’t \ngo away. \n2. Pain or something sore on your \nvulva. \n3. A change in the skin on your vulva.\nLike red, lighter or darker areas.\nOr skin that is thicker than before. \n4. A mole on the vulva that changes\nshape or colour. A mole is like a\ndark spot. \n5.

B\nlood coming from your vagina\nwhen you do not think there\nshould be blood. \nFor example, bleeding between your \nperiods if you have them. \nOr bleeding after the menopause has \nhappened. This is when women stop \nhaving periods for good. \n7. \nStuff coming out of your vagina\nthat has blood in it. \nFor example, it might be pink, brown or \nr\ned with some blood in it. \nThe stuff coming out of your vagina    \nis called discharge.

    "content": "GENETIC TESTING IN  \nOVARIAN CANCER\n\nForeword\nWe all have thousands of genes. They are vital for life and hold the information \nour bodies use to grow and function properly. In some cases, genes play a role \nin protecting us from cancer. \nIf you, or someone close to you, has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer,  \nyou may well hear about certain genes and be asked to consider whether you \nwould like to be tested to see if you have any alterations on them (sometimes \ncalled gene mutations).  \nKnowing if you have alterations on certain genes may \nbe very important \nSometimes genes can become altered, meaning that they do not work in quite \nthe way they should. Genetic testing checks to see if you have any of these \naltered genes. If we know this, we can tell if a person may be at a higher risk  \nof developing some cancers. For those already diagnosed with a cancer  \n(such as ovarian cancer), it also helps to assess what the most appropriate \ntreatment may be.  \nOver the past two decades, there has been significant progress in our \nunderstanding of genes and the role they play in some cancers if they  \nbecome altered. Having this knowledge should therefore help you or your \nfamily to make any important decisions.  \nAsk Eve is always here to help \nGenetic testing can be complicated, and it is not always easy to be sure of the \nbest thing to do. To help you better understand your options, The Eve Appeal \nhas developed this booklet using the latest clinical guidance developed by \nthe British Gynaecological Cancer Society and the British Association of \nGynaecological Pathology. \nBut of course, every person’s situation is different.

You received half of yours from each parent, and any \nbiological children you may have would have inherited half of their genes  \nfrom you. \nAre genes inherited?\nThere are a number of reasons for a gene becoming altered. This can be \nsimply through chance, or because of environmental factors, such as exposure \nto certain substances, or lifestyle factors, such as obesity or smoking. \nIt is not always clear what the cause is, and it may be a combination of factors.\nHow does a gene alteration happen?\nIf a person has a gene alteration, it does not always mean that it will be  \npassed onto their children. A test is needed to check whether the alteration \nhas passed down or not. \nIf a gene alteration is hereditary and can therefore be passed to children,  \nthere is a 50% chance that a child may inherit it, whether they are female  \nor male. \nIt is important to note that, even if a person has inherited a gene alteration  \nthat may increase their risk of cancer, it does not mean they will always \ndevelop cancer.\nAre all gene alterations passed on to children?\nIf you have been tested and told that you have a gene alteration that puts you \nat an increased risk of cancer, it may mean that you need to be more vigilant  \nof symptoms.\nIt could also mean that you may be able to access some forms of cancer \nprevention on the NHS, such as screening or risk-reduction surgery.\nDoes having a gene alteration mean you need to \nlook out for cancer symptoms?\nSometimes the information in a gene can become altered. You may hear this \ntalked about as a gene alteration, gene mutation or as a ‘pathogenic variant’. \nGenerally, these all mean the same thing – that there is a slight change in a \ngene that means it is not working as it should.\nWhat are gene alterations / mutations?\n\nBRCA GENES\n67\nTwo genes that are commonly talked about in ovarian cancer are BRCA1  \nand BRCA2. \nAlterations in these genes increase the chance of ovarian cancer developing \nand may influence whether certain types of treatment are given. \nBRCA1 and BRCA2 are also commonly linked to breast and prostate cancer,  \nso they can affect both women and men. They are not the only genes that  \nare linked to cancer so you may hear of others.\nWhat are BRCA genes?\nEveryone has BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. They are known as tumour \nsuppressor genes as they play a role in protecting us from cancer. \nThey do this by helping to prevent the cells in our bodies from growing  \nand dividing out of control. \nWhat do BRCA genes do? \nIf there is a significant alteration in either of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes,  \nthey may lose the ability to protect us from a cancer developing.\nWhat happens when a BRCA gene has an alteration? \nAround 1 in every 400 people in the general population will have a  \nBRCA gene alteration.\nIn some populations, they are more frequent. People of Ashkenazi Jewish \ndescent, for example, have around a 1 in 40 chance of carrying a BRCA  \ngene alteration.\n1\nHow common are BRCA gene alterations? \nSome treatment options for advanced ovarian cancer are influenced by  \nBRCA status so knowing this can help guide your clinical team.\nDoes having a BRCA gene alteration impact \ntreatment in ovarian cancer? \nBelow is a table with the increased cancer risk associated with alterations  \nin the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. There is risk for both men and women; \nhowever, you should always remember that an increased risk does not  \nmake it certain a cancer will develop. \nWhat is the risk a BRCA gene alteration will  \nresult in a cancer developing?  \n*Estimated lifetime risk (up to age 70) for people with BRCA1/2 alterations (mutations). \nSource: Royal Marsden Beginner’s Guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2\nGeneBRCA1BRCA2\nBreast cancer in unaffected  \nwomen (up to age 80)\n60-90%45-85%\nWomen with cancer in one \nbreast - risk of developing \ncancer in the other breast\n50% lifetime risk \n~\n10% 5 year risk\n50% lifetime risk \n~\n5-10% 5 year risk\nOvarian cancer, lifetime risk\n40-60% \n(Risk increases \nfrom age 40)\n10-30% (Risk increases \nfrom mid-late 40s)\nMale breast cancer, lifetime risk0.1-1%5-10%\nProstate cancer, lifetime risk\n~\n10% \nsimilar to  \npopulation risk\n20-25%\nOverall, around 15-17%\n2\n of ovarian cancers are linked to a BRCA gene alteration. \nHowever, they are found in some types of ovarian cancer more than others. \nIn Ashkenazi Jewish women, up to 40% of ovarian cancers are caused  \nby BRCA gene alterations.\n3\nHow common is it to find a BRCA gene alteration  \nin ovarian cancer?\n\nWHY GENETIC \nTESTING IS  \nIMPORTANT\nIn ovarian cancer, genetic testing involves taking a sample of blood,  \ntumour or saliva and then analysing it to see if the DNA inside the cells \ncontains any alterations. \nWhat is genetic testing?\n89\nGenetic testing is an option for many people diagnosed with ovarian \ncancer, so it is important to ask your clinical team early on about \nwhether it may be suitable for you. \nIn some cases, testing may not be suitable, or you may not feel ready. \nIf this is the case, do not worry and be sure to discuss what options are \nopen to you with your nurse, oncologist, or you can Ask Eve. \nIs everyone with ovarian cancer able to get a \ngenetic test? \nWhat are the benefits?\nThe presence of certain gene alterations, such as on the BRCA1 and \nBRCA2 genes, can have several implications:\n    If you have ovarian cancer, it may help guide your treatment choices \n    It can determine your risk of developing other types of cancer (such as \nbreast cancer) and help you decide if you would like to take measures \nto help prevent these\n    It can provide important information for your family, as some gene \nalterations can be passed on to children\n If you have a hereditary gene alteration, your family members may be eligible for \ngenetic testing on the NHS. They can then make informed decisions about if they \nshould be tested or consider options to help prevent cancer from occurring.\nIf you have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you will most commonly  \nbe offered testing to look at your BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2). \nOther gene alterations play a role in ovarian cancer (and other cancers),  \nso you may be tested for a panel of genes known to be linked to increased \ncancer risk.\nWhat gene alterations are being tested for? \nAcross the UK, there is variation as  \nto when, or if, a genetic test is offered \nafter a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. \nIn England, the National Genomic Test \nDirectory specifies which genomic  \ntests the NHS should offer and who \nwould be eligible. \nIn Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \nthe process is likely to be similar, but \nmay differ from place to place.\nIs genetic testing \nthe same across all \nparts of the UK? \nAsk about  \ngenetic testing\nWe would encourage you to  \nbring up the topic of genetic \ntesting with your clinical team  \nas early as possible. \nIf you feel that you would like to \nhave testing but are unsure if you \ncan (or should), you can always \ncontact Ask Eve for advice.\n\n1011\nWHAT\nTESTING \nINVOLVES\nTypes of tests you may have\nYour clinical team will decide on the most appropriate test for you  \nbased on your specific circumstances. There are three main tests  \nused in ovarian cancer:\nTaking a blood sample  \nThis looks for inherited gene alterations (known as germline). \nThe results may have implications for family members as well \nas for the person being tested.\nTaking a sample of saliva  \nWhile not common on the NHS unless as part of the NHS \nJewish BRCA testing programme, saliva testing also looks \nfor inherited (germline) alterations. It simply involves giving a \nsample of saliva. In some cases, this can be provided as a kit \nto do at home.\nTaking a sample of the tumour itself \nKnown as tumour testing, this involves extracting DNA from \nthe tumour itself. If this test is positive (for example, showing \na BRCA gene alteration), then a blood or saliva test will be \nrequired to confirm if there is a risk of it being hereditary. \nIf you have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, when is testing  \nusually done? \nIf testing is appropriate, it is usually offered early on, during the initial stages \nof treatment. However, your clinical team will also consider the timing of your \nongoing (or planned) therapy and any support that may be needed.\nSome examples of times when genetic testing may be discussed with  \nyou include: \n  At initial consultation, when ovarian cancer is suspected or diagnosed.\n  At a consultation before surgery. \n  At a consultation after surgery.\n  During a consultation for chemotherapy.\n\nYou may be offered blood and tumour testing at the  \nsame time. This is known as parallel testing. \nIf the results show the presence (or possible presence)  \nof alterations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, you may  \nbe referred to a genetics service for follow up.\nParallel testing \n1213\nIt is completely understandable to feel anxious about genetic testing.  \nYour cancer team will be able to take you through the process and  \ndiscuss what the implications may be for you and your family. \nIf you would like additional support, you can also ask to be referred to a \ngenetic counsellor who will specialise in the issues you may be facing.  \nAccess to a genetic counsellor \nIf you choose to have genetic testing, you will be  \nasked to review and complete a form that summarises  \nyour discussion. \nYou should be given time to carefully review any forms  \nor information. If anything is unclear, or if you need  \nany wording explained or translated, bring this  \nup with your cancer team as soon as possible. \nGiving your consent\n  Looks for inherited gene alterations\n    May have implications for family  \nmembers and the person being tested\n  Takes DNA from the tumour\n    If a gene alteration is found  \nanother test will be needed to  \nconfirm if hereditary\n\n15\nGETTING  \nYOUR  \nRESULTS \nResults will usually be delivered by the health  \nprofessional who took the original test sample(s),  \neither over the phone or face to face.\nResults can include a lot of unfamiliar language and should  \nalways be given to you by a trained professional. You should  \nalso feel free to ask any questions you may have. \nSome of the common terms you may see or hear include:\nPathogenic  \nSometimes referred to as ‘positive’, this means the test shows  \nyou have a gene alteration that is very likely to be cancer-causing.\nLikely Pathogenic \nThe test shows an alteration that is likely to be cancer-causing. \nVariant of Uncertain Significance \nThe test shows an alteration that is known; however, there is uncertainty of its \nbehaviour. It is not currently known to be cancer-causing and should not affect \nyour care. It may be that, in the future, more becomes known about this alteration. \nLikely Not Pathogenic \nSometimes referred to as ‘negative’, the test shows a gene alteration that is \nunlikely to be cancer-causing. \nNot Pathogenic \nThe test shows an alteration that is understood not to be cancer-causing.\n14\nYou had both a blood and a tumour test (parallel testing)  \nIf you were given both a blood test and a tumour test at the same \ntime, your clinical team will be able to make a fully-informed \ndecision about your treatment and talk through any implications for \nyou and your family. \nYou had a blood test (germline testing)   \nIf you were given just a blood test initially, and this comes back \nnegative for a BRCA gene alteration, your team may still advise \nthat you have a tumour test to check for non-inherited (somatic) \ngene alterations, as these may influence your treatment choices. \nThere can be several reasons for this, but it will likely be because \nyour clinical team suspects the presence of a BRCA gene \nalteration based on your symptoms.  \nYou had a tumour test \nIf you were given a tumour test initially, and this shows you do not \nhave a BRCA gene alteration, you may still be advised to have  \na blood test to check for possible hereditary gene alterations. \nThis is because not all alterations are always detected from tumour \ntesting and the results from a blood test may have important \nimplications for your family.\nWhat happens after you receive your results will depend partly on the test  \nor tests that you have had.\nWhat happens after I get my results?  \nIf your results show a variant of uncertain significance, your clinical team will \nlikely treat this as a negative result. However, they will note the findings in your \npatient record. \nAlthough unlikely, should the gene alteration found become reclassified by the \ntesting laboratory as disease-causing at a later date, you would be contacted \nand the implications discussed with you.\nA variant of uncertain significance (VUS) \nWhat could my test results look like?\nPassing hereditary gene alterations on to children  \nHereditary genes alterations have a 50% chance of being passed on to \nchildren (of either gender).\n\nINFORMING \nFAMILY  \nMEMBERS\nIf you are worried about how to talk about your test results with family \nmembers, you should be able to discuss this with a genetic counsellor.\nIt may also be possible to ask your GP or cancer team for a letter that explains \nyour results to family members, and any steps they may need to consider. \nIs there support to communicate with  \nfamily members?\nIs it possible to minimise risk through  \nlifestyle choices?\nWhile it is not certain what causes ovarian cancer, there is good \nevidence to suggest that maintaining a healthy weight and not \nsmoking reduces risk. \nWhether they are female or male, if a member of your family is at risk  \nof having inherited a gene alteration that is known to be cancer-causing  \nthey should discuss their options with a GP or specialist. \nThey will be able to refer them on for genetic testing to see if they carry  \nthe same gene alteration. \nIf they are shown to have a gene alteration, they may have the option of:\nCan they access screening or preventative care?\nScreening or regular \nchecks aimed at \nspotting a cancer as \nearly as possible \nPreventative care, \nsuch as surgery to \nhelp prevent ovarian \nor breast cancer\n1716\n\n1819\nFrequently asked questions\nCan I get a test privately if not on the NHS?\nIt is possible to get some genetic testing done privately. \nWe would always advise that you speak to your clinical team, a trained \ncounsellor, or Ask Eve before deciding to have testing done if it is not provided \nby the NHS. \nDo I need a genetic test to access treatment? \nA genetic test may be used to see what the best treatment option(s) would be. \nAn example of this is in ovarian cancer, where you may need a test before \nbeing given certain medicines.\nI am nervous about the results, what if I could have \npassed a higher risk of cancer to my children or \ngrandchildren?  \nIt is natural to be concerned about the risk of passing certain gene alterations \nonto children or grandchildren. However, this knowledge can be very \nimportant for them to have and may help protect them or mean that they are \nbetter able to spot any cancer early.\nIf you feel like you need to discuss this in detail, you may be able to with a \ngenetic counsellor through the NHS.\nDo I have to tell a relative if I have a gene alteration \nthey could have inherited?  \nYou are under no obligation to disclose your results. However, the findings \ncould carry important implications for others in your family.  \nIf you would like to discuss your options, or you need help in how you might \ntell family members, this support should be available to you. \nIt may be possible that your genetics team can contact members of your family \non your behalf by letter if needed. \nI feel guilty about passing on a cancer-causing \nalteration – what should I do? \nThere is a lot of debate about what causes gene alterations. What is important \nto remember is that it is never a person’s fault. \nIt is natural to be worried about the implications for you and family members.  \nIf you need support on this issue, please speak to your clinical team or contact \nAsk Eve using the details in this booklet. \nHow long does it take to get results?\nOnce the sample has been taken it can take a few weeks to get the results. \nA typical wait would be between 2 to 8 weeks. \nWill having a BRCA gene alteration affect  \nmy insurance? \nWhile a diagnosis of ovarian cancer may affect your ability to get insurance, \nhaving a test for a gene alteration such as BRCA will not impact this or \ninfluence existing insurance premiums. This is because there is broad \nagreement that having a test should not affect insurance. You can find out \nmore on the Government website.\nCan results be  \nuncertain / inconclusive? \nWhile unlikely, it is possible that a test  \ncould need to be redone or that the  \nresults will come back as inconclusive. \nIn these cases your cancer team  \nwould explain any impact on your  \ncare and what they recommend  \nas a next step.\n\n2021\nGlossary\nBiopsy\nThis is a medical procedure that involves taking a small sample of body tissue \nso it can be examined under a microscope. \nDNA\nThis stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. Present in nearly every cell in the body, \nDNA contains lots of genes, which carry the genetic information that acts as \nthe instructions the body needs to grow and function properly. \nGermline testing  \nIn genetic testing, germline refers to alterations in genes that can be passed \ndown through generations (are hereditary/inherited).\nGermline gene alterations will be present in all cells and will therefore show up \nin blood or saliva tests, as well as most tumour tests.\nHigh-grade serous ovarian cancer  \nThis is the most common form of epithelial ovarian cancer. \nOvarian cancer  \nOvarian cancer is commonly used as an umbrella term for ovarian and \nFallopian Tube cancer. \nPathogenic \nA pathogenic gene alteration/mutation means that it is potentially  \ncancer-causing. \nSomatic alteration / mutation \nA somatic alteration (or mutation) means a change to the gene which is present \nin the tumour alone and is not found throughout the rest of the body. \nIt is important to note that having a somatic gene alteration in the tumour  \ntissue does not mean that you cannot also have a germline (hereditary)  \ngene alteration. \n\nTHE PROCESS OF \nBRCA TESTING \n \nFOR PEOPLE WITH \nOVARIAN CANCER\nYOU HAVE A GENE \nALTERATION \n \n(BRCA1/BRCA2)\nThis means that your test \nhas shown you have a gene \nalteration that is likely to be \nthe cause of your cancer. \nDepending on the type of  \ntest you have had, this may \nshow an alteration that is only \nin the tumour, or one that is  \nnot only in the tumour and  \nmay be hereditary.\nIf you have had a tumour  \ntest, you may be offered a \nblood test as well.\nYOU DO NOT HAVE  \nA GENE ALTERATION \nThis means that your test has \nshown you do not  \nhave a gene alteration.\nYOU HAVE A VARIANT \nOF UNCERTAIN \nSIGNIFICANCE (VUS) \nThis means you do have a \ngene alteration, but it is not \nknown to be cancer-causing \nand will not affect your care. \nA small proportion of these \nmay get re-classified as \ncancer-causing in the future \nas we learn more about  \nthese alterations. If you  \nhave a VUS it will be noted \nin your patient record. \nGETTING  \nYOUR RESULTS\nYour results can be \ndelivered in person \nor over the phone. \nIf possible, it is \nrecommended that you \nask for a face to face or \nvideo consultation. \nResults should always \nbe explained by a \ntrained oncologist, \ngynaecologist, or other \nmember of your cancer \nteam, such as a nurse \nspecialist. \nIf you feel anxious about \nyour results, you should \nbe given the option of \ncounselling.\nWhether positive or negative, your results \nwill help inform your treatment options so \nthat you can receive the best care. \nWhile this diagram shows a typical process, every person is different. If you have \nquestions, ask your cancer team or speak to Ask Eve, who can provide more information. \nEvery person is different  \nINITIAL DISCUSSION \nWITH YOUR \n \nCANCER TEAM \nGenetic testing is likely \nto be brought up by \nyour cancer team.  \nThis can take place \nany time after your \ndiagnosis. If you are \nconcerned about the \nimplications, it may be \npossible to speak to a \ncounsellor at this point.\nGIVING YOUR CONSENT  \nConsent will usually be \nneeded, and your cancer \nteam will discuss this \nwith you. You should be \nprovided with information \non the implications for \nyourself and your family  \nas part of this process. \nIf you provide your consent \nverbally, this will be \ndocumented in your notes.\nREFERRAL FOR  \nA GENETIC TEST\nThe type of test(s) you are \nreferred for will be based \non national guidelines. \nYou may be referred for a \nblood test, a tumour test \nor both (known as parallel \ntesting).\n123\nHAVING A TUMOUR \nTEST\nTumour testing involves \ntaking a sample of the \ntumour (via a biopsy or \nduring an operation).\nTumour testing results \nmay have implications \nfor family members, \nalthough this is not \nalways the case.\nHAVING A BLOOD \nOR SALIVA TEST \n(GERMLINE \nTESTING) \nBlood and saliva tests \nlook for germline \ngene alterations. \nThese are ones that \ncan be inherited \nand passed down \nthrough generations. \n4A\n4B\n5\n6A\n6B\n6C\n2322\n\nGenetic Testing in \nOvarian Cancer \nEMAIL:  \nnurse@eveappeal.org.uk \nCALL:  \n0808 802 0019\nWEBSITE:  \nwww.eveappeal.org.uk\nInformation reviewed: April 2024.
