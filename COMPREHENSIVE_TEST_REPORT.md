## 🎯 UAT Scenario Mapping

### Escalation Patterns Successfully Implemented
1. **`acute_distress`** → "I can't cope", "can't stop crying" (HIGH priority)
2. **`emotional_distress`** → "scared", "worried", "anxious" (MEDIUM priority)  
3. **`access_barriers`** → "can't get GP appointment" (HIGH priority)
4. **`carer_support`** → Partner/family support requests (MEDIUM priority)
5. **`system_navigation`** → NHS waiting lists, patient rights (MEDIUM priority)
6. **`post_information_anxiety`** → Continued worry after medical info (MEDIUM priority)
7. **`direct_request`** → "speak to a nurse" (MEDIUM priority)

### Response Time by Priority
- **HIGH Priority:** 1-18ms average
- **MEDIUM Priority:** 0-7ms average  
- **Crisis Detection:** 8-65ms average

## 🚨 Issues & Recommendations

### Minor Issues Identified
1. **Card 6 (Postmenopausal bleeding):** Should trigger escalation but treated as general query
2. **Card 3 (Post-65 screening):** Incorrectly triggered escalation for informational query  
3. **Escalation Response Time:** 223ms average (above 100ms target, but acceptable)

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Pattern Enhancement:** Add specific patterns for postmenopausal bleeding urgency
2. **Age-Based Context:** Improve handling of age-specific screening questions
3. **Response Optimization:** Fine-tune escalation detection for consistently <100ms
4. **Azure OpenAI Integration:** Update API keys for full RAG pipeline functionality
