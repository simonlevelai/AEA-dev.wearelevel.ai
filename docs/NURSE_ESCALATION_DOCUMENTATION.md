# Ask Eve Assist - Nurse Escalation System Documentation

## ðŸ©º Overview

The Ask Eve Assist Nurse Escalation System provides a GDPR-compliant pathway for healthcare users to connect with registered nurses when they need additional support beyond the chatbot's information services. This system was designed based on analysis of 15 User Acceptance Testing (UAT) scenario cards to ensure real-world healthcare workflow integration.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### UAT-Informed Design
- **15 Healthcare Scenarios Analyzed**: Real user journeys from UAT_ScenarioCards v0.3.pdf
- **9 Escalation Triggers**: Context-aware pattern matching for healthcare situations
- **Priority Routing**: Low, medium, and high priority escalations based on scenario urgency
- **Crisis Differentiation**: Nurse support separate from emergency crisis detection

### GDPR-Compliant Data Collection
1. **Data Usage Explanation**: Clear explanation of how collected data will be used
2. **Informed Consent**: Explicit consent gathering before any data collection
3. **Name Collection**: Personalized interaction with name validation
4. **Contact Method Selection**: User choice between phone or email contact
5. **Contact Details**: UK-format phone number or email validation
6. **Confirmation & Modification**: Review and edit capability before submission
7. **Completion**: Automated handover to healthcare team

### Healthcare Integration
- **Teams Webhook Notifications**: Automated nurse notifications with conversation context
- **Conversation Summarization**: AI-generated summaries for healthcare handovers
- **Priority-Based Routing**: High priority cases flagged for immediate attention
- **UK Healthcare Compliance**: Phone and email validation for NHS integration

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### EscalationState Interface
```typescript
interface EscalationState {
    isActive: boolean;
    step: 'none' | 'consent' | 'name' | 'contact_method' | 'contact_details' | 'confirmation' | 'completed';
    triggerType?: string;
    scenario?: string;
    priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    startTime?: number;
    consentGiven?: boolean;
    userName?: string;
    contactMethod?: 'phone' | 'email';
    contactDetails?: string;
    timeoutWarning?: boolean;
}
```

#### Escalation Triggers
```typescript
interface EscalationTrigger {
    pattern: RegExp;
    scenario: string;
    priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    description: string;
    uatCard: string;
}
```

### UAT-Based Escalation Patterns

| UAT Card | Trigger Example | Scenario Type | Priority | Description |
|----------|----------------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Card 1 | "I'm scared about my results" | emotional_distress | medium | Abnormal smear test anxiety |
| Card 4 | "I'm worried about the treatment" | emotional_distress | medium | Treatment concerns |
| Card 11 | "I can't cope with this" | emotional_distress | high | Emotional crisis requiring immediate support |
| Card 12 | "My partner doesn't understand" | support_request | medium | Relationship/family support needs |
| Card 14 | "I can't get an appointment" | healthcare_access | high | GP access barriers |
| Card 15 | "I'm confused about what to do next" | information_request | low | Navigation and process confusion |
| Direct | "I want to speak to a nurse" | direct_nurse_request | medium | Explicit nurse request |
| Post-Info | "I'm still worried after reading" | post_information_anxiety | medium | Continued anxiety after information |
| Appointment | "I need help booking an appointment" | appointment_assistance | medium | Practical healthcare navigation |

## ðŸ“‹ Workflow Process

### 1. Trigger Detection
- **Pattern Matching**: Real-time analysis of user messages for escalation triggers
- **Context Awareness**: Integration with conversation history and user emotional state
- **Priority Assessment**: Automatic priority assignment based on trigger type and scenario

### 2. GDPR Data Collection Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Trigger Detected] --> B[Data Usage Explanation]
    B --> C[Consent Request]
    C --> D{Consent Given?}
    D -->|No| E[End Process]
    D -->|Yes| F[Name Collection]
    F --> G[Contact Method Selection]
    G --> H[Contact Details Collection]
    H --> I[Validation]
    I --> J{Valid Details?}
    J -->|No| K[Error Message + Retry]
    K --> H
    J -->|Yes| L[Confirmation Review]
    L --> M{User Confirms?}
    M -->|No| N[Allow Modifications]
    N --> G
    M -->|Yes| O[Send to Healthcare Team]
    O --> P[Completion Confirmation]
```

### 3. Healthcare Team Notification

```typescript
interface TeamNotification {
    escalationType: string;
    priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    patientName: string;
    contactMethod: 'phone' | 'email';
    contactDetails: string;
    conversationSummary: string;
    triggerScenario: string;
    timestamp: string;
    estimatedResponseTime: string;
}
```
