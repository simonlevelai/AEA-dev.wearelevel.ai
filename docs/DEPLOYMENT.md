- **Safety Systems Preserved**: EscalationService, SafetyMiddleware, NotificationService
- **GitHub CI/CD**: Automated testing, security scans, cost validation
- **Azure Infrastructure**: ARM templates for deployment under £50/month
- **UK Compliance**: Data residency enforced, security configurations validated

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Ready
- **App Service**: B1 Basic tier for reliable hosting
- **Azure AI Search**: Free tier for content retrieval
- **Cosmos DB**: Serverless for conversation storage
- **Key Vault**: Secure secret management
- **Application Insights**: Cost-controlled monitoring (10% sampling)
- **Cost Monitoring**: Alerts at £40, £45, £48 thresholds

## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run Tests (CRITICAL - Safety Systems)
```bash
npm test
npm run test:safety
npm run lint
```

### 3. Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3978/widget for web chat
# Visit http://localhost:3978/health for health check
```

### 4. Azure Deployment (When Ready)
```bash
# Configure Azure CLI
az login

# Deploy to development environment
./deploy/scripts/deploy.sh \\
  --environment dev \\
  --resource-group "rg-askeve-dev" \\
  --subscription "your-subscription-id" \\
  --email "alerts@yourdomain.com"
```

## 🔐 Required Azure Secrets
These secrets need to be configured in Azure Key Vault:
- `openai-api-key`: OpenAI API key for AI responses
- `eve-appeal-api-key`: The Eve Appeal content API key (if applicable)
- `teams-webhook-url`: Microsoft Teams webhook for nurse escalation
- `emergency-contact-webhook`: Emergency notification endpoint

## 🛡️ Safety Systems Active
- **Crisis Detection**: <2 second response for self-harm indicators
- **Medical Emergency**: Immediate escalation for urgent health concerns
- **Source Validation**: 100% attribution to eveappeal.org.uk sources
- **Cost Monitoring**: Real-time budget tracking and alerts

## 📊 Cost Monitoring
- **Target**: Under £50/month for production
- **Alerts**: Automated notifications at 80%, 90%, 96% of budget
- **Optimization**: 10% Application Insights sampling, Free tier AI Search

## 🏥 Health Service Requirements
This is a **life-critical health service** - all deployments must:
- ✅ Pass safety system tests
- ✅ Maintain <2 second crisis response time
- ✅ Ensure UK data residency compliance
- ✅ Preserve emergency escalation procedures
- ✅ Monitor cost limits continuously

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Local Development**: Ensure Node.js 20.x is installed
- **Tests Failing**: Check that all mock services are properly configured
- **Deployment Issues**: Verify Azure CLI authentication and subscription permissions
- **Cost Alerts**: Check that budget monitoring is configured correctly
