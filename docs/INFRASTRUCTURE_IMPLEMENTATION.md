   - System performance degradation warnings
   - Automated incident response triggers

3. **Comprehensive Dashboard Integration**
   - Real-time health status monitoring
   - Provider performance metrics
   - SLA compliance tracking
   - Alert management interface

### ✅ Azure Infrastructure Redundancy
**Requirement**: Multi-region deployment with automatic failover

**Implemented Components**:
1. **Secondary Azure OpenAI Region** (`deploy/azure-failover-template.json`)
   - Deployed Azure OpenAI service in UK West region
   - Identical model deployments (GPT-4o-mini)
   - Cross-region health monitoring
   - Automated failover scenarios

2. **Enhanced Security Infrastructure**
   - Automated secret rotation (90-day cycle)
   - Request size limits (2MB maximum)
   - Rate limiting with progressive delays
   - DDoS protection and WAF rules configuration

### ✅ Performance Optimization & Circuit Breakers
**Requirement**: <3 second failover time with graceful degradation

**Implemented Components**:
1. **Circuit Breaker Patterns**
   - Per-provider circuit breakers with configurable thresholds
   - Automatic recovery testing and re-enablement
   - Metrics collection for circuit breaker state changes
   - Integration with SLA monitoring system

2. **Failover Testing Suite** (`src/services/__tests__/FailoverIntegration.test.ts`)
   - Automated testing of all failover scenarios
   - Load testing under provider failures
   - Performance benchmarking for each tier
   - End-to-end failover validation
